DHLP-1 and DHLP-2

Giraph based distributed label propagation algorithms on heterogeneous drug-related networks

The source codes for two scalable label propagation algorithms called DHLP-1 and DHLP-2 are provided. The data must be in Apache Giraph input format. Here, sample data for DHLP-1 and DHLP-2 is uploaded, which provides the data input format used in the codes. In the files, giraph.algorithms.minprop.App8 is DHLP-1 and giraph.algorithms.minprop.App9 is DHLP-2.

minprop-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT is the executable jar file.
